This Hand Writing Recognition program can recognize the hand written digits from 0 to 9.
I made this using Support Vector Machine(SVM) machine learning algorithm.
You can comment the content between the dashed lines in the program that is just for checking the accuracy of the algorithm.
The program will ask you for the image path so give it the correct path and the image should be written with a thick brush.
Don't worry about the image pixels because program first converts the image in 8x8 pixels and then proceeds further.
I am adding a sample image in the repository. You can check the sample images named FourRB.jpeg and Three2.jpeg

Thank You.
